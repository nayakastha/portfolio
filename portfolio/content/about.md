I'm a undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. I'm interested in pretty much anything in the realm of coding and computer science, which is why I love to learn about new technology! I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.

## What I Do

I do a lot of app development with Flutter and Kotlin. I started by creating lots of quick projects through hackathons which led to more long-term projects with organizations. You can check out some of the projects that I've worked on [here](/projects/).

I also try a bit of core computer science. I'm most comfortable with C++ since I use the language almost every day and its syntax is easy to understand. I have experimented with various data structures for problem solving. Apart from that, I have tried my hands out with Database Management and Automata Designing.

Aside from programming skills, I like to spend my time volunteering in community and helping others interested in coding. I occasionally direct Flutter and App Development workshop and share my knowledge through participating in hackathons. Of course, I'm always looking for opportunities to learn from others as well!

## Goals for future

* **Learn Web Technologies**

    With the sheer growt of one-code-base technologies, getting a hold of web based technologies in depth is the urgency of the present times. Websites can target the biggest and broadest audience, unlike the restrictions to a platform that constrain native applications.

* **Experiment more with Flutter**

    I don't even play games that much but I want to learn game development because I feel like it would be fun. Flutter hits the sweet spot of enabling a single codebase to deliver beautiful, fast, tailored experiences with high developer productivity for both platforms. In parallel, the core Flutter project has been making progress to enable desktop-class apps, with input paradigms such as keyboard and mouse, window resizing, and tooling for Chrome OS app development.

* **Take a Bunch of Online Courses**

    Whenever I have time, I like to take online courses related to the things I'd like to learn. There are so many amazing free resources out there such as those on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/). I recommend [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=b6459cfd2f2a089c0e2e55310418cb55&position=1) by HarvardX. I learned so much throughout this course which aided in my performance during my entire student life.
