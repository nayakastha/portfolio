# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
 This is the repository containing the code for portfolio website of Astha Nayak. Checkout the website at [asthanayak.tech](https://asthanayak.tech)

This repo contains an easy-to-customize personal dev portfolio template that was created with Flutter. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes loaded with awesome modern user interface. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.

The setup required can be broken into two types:

- If you just want to add your information as use as is

#### Irrespective of type of output you have to do the following:
1. `Install Flutter on your machine`
- Install flutter by selecting the operating system on which you are installing Flutter: [Flutter installation tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- To check if you have flutter installed along wtih proper necesarry SDKs installed run flutter doctor

2. `Fork and Clone the Repository`

3. Get Packages
- Make sure you are in the `portfolio/portfolio` directory.
- From the terminal: Run `flutter pub get`. OR
    From Android Studio/IntelliJ: Click Packages get in the action ribbon at the top of pubspec.yaml.
    From VS Code: Click Get Packages located in right side of the action ribbon at the top of pubspec.yaml.

#### Making Edits / Customizing the Template
To setup, simply move to the `values` directory and change the values of colors, fonts, and other variables. You can also add your own custom styles and scripts.
